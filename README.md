# CKAD-labs
this repo has all the labs that I created while completing the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam topics.

the labs built in this repository will be using the demo application that is built in this repo.

## What does the CKAD consist of 
25% - Application Environment, Configuration, and Security

        - Discover and use resources that extend K8s 
        - Understand authentication, authorization and admission control 
        - Understanding and defining resource requirements, limits, and quotas 
        - understand ConfigMaps
        - Create and consume secrets 
        - understand ServiceAccounts
        - understand SecurityContexts

20% - Application Design and Build 

        - Define, build and modify container images 
        - Understand jobs and CronJobs 
        - Understand multi-container Pod design patters 
        - Utilize persistent and ephemeral volumes

20% - Application Deployment 

        - Use Kubernetes primitives to implement common deployment strategies 
        - understand deployments and how to perform rolling updates
        - use the help package manager to deploy existing packages 

20% - Services and Networking 

        - Demonstrate basic understanding of NetworkPolicies 
        - Provide and troubleshoot access to applications via services
        - Use Ingress rules to expose applications

15% - Application observability and maintenance 

        - Undersand API deprecations 
        - Implement probes and heath checks
        - use provided tools to monitor Kubernetes applications 
        - Utilized container logs 
        - Debugging in Kubernetes
